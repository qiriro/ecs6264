title: Scheduling of Independent Tasks
tldr: "Discusses scheduling algorithms for independent tasks. Four basic algorithms are discussed: rate monotonic, inverse deadline, earliest deadline first, and least laxity first. These algorithms deal with homogeneous sets of tasks, where tasks are either periodic or aperiodic. However, real-time applications often require both types of tasks. In this context, periodic tasks usually have hard timing constraints and are scheduled with one of the four basic algorithms. Aperiodic tasks
have either soft or hard timing constraints."
